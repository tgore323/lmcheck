**Checks the French Linux Mint mirrors for newly uploaded ISOs**   

When new ISOs of *Linux Mint* are released, they are released to the French mirrors first. The creator of *Linux Mint* is based in France, so this makes perfect sense. All this program does is to check for any new additions. If it finds there are new ISOs in the directory, it alerts the user to that fact. 

The URLs this script checks are placed into the urls.txt file in the same directory as lmcheck.py
